This is (supposed to be) a quiz to test your Javascript knowledge.

## Project Status

This project is incomplete but WILL (and I mean it) be completed at a later date, once I actually know how JavaScript works.

## About
This project was supposed to showcase my working knowledge of JavaScript. I don't actually have much skills when it comes to JavaScript, which is very apparent now. 

I used bootstrap and CSS to style the jumbotron and button in the HTML. Besides that, I struggeled A LOT.

## Usage
The user is supposed to have 30 seconds to answer 5 questions about JavaScript. As the timer counts down and the user answers questions, their score will be tracked. The final score will then be saved in local storage with the user's initials, so they can compare their score.

## Roadmap
Ideas for future releases would include actually being able to finish this homework assignment.

## Authors and Acknowledgment
I, Haley Medina, created this project solely by myself. My tutor didn't have any time slots availible to help me before this assignment was due, and I refused to use other's code (e.g. my friends') becuase I REALLY wanted to know WHY it worked. 

However, I just bought a book that explains literally EVERYTHING I need to know. I'm on ch. 3, so wish me luck, grader(s).
